# IoT-Embedded-Development

Several Projects and Notes of “Internet of Things(with Embedded Development)”.

- **Check_Code**

   The Check Code is mainly to solve the problem of data transmission and exchange between computer components and ensure the correctness of the transmission process. The use of Check Code can improve the reliability of the hardware circuit and the code checking ability. There are two programs in this folder that are **CheckSum** and **CRC16**.

- **Embedded_Development**

  There is a Temperature and Humidity Measurement Alarm System based on **STM32F103C8T6**. The data will be displayed on the OLED Display. Apart from that, the Buzzer  Alarm will be triggered when the temperature or humidity is too high. The project also supports the function of reporting temperature and humidity data to Android/Harmony OS via WLAN.

- **Network_Port_Test**

   There's a program of network port communication implementation based on C#.

- **Serial_Port_Test**

   There's a program of serial port communication implementation based on C#.
